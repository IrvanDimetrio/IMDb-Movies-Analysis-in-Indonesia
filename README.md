## 🤔Problems in Real Lifes
* Based on the author's curiosity about the development of the film industry in Indonesia, especially from 2000 - 2022.
* The IMDB website can be a benchmark for whether the film is liked by the audience or not so that it can be an evaluation material for the next filmmaking.

## 📝Goal & Objective
To find out how many films have been produced in Indonesia and provide insight to the director about what films are liked by audiences in Indonesia.

## ⭐ Conclusion
*   The Indonesian film industry is still very capable of continuing to grow, given the data that many Short Movies have been made which can be seeds to continue on to big screen films with a longer duration.
*   Film genres in Indonesia are still dominated by the genres of Drama, Horror, Comedy and Romance films. However, there are genres such as Action which are in great demand by Indonesian people, especially in the film The Raid.
*   For the time in the film there seems to be no problem with an average time of 89 minutes. Of course, the audience doesn't want to sit in the cinema for hours with the exception of a number of films that are highly anticipated or people who are enthusiastic about watching long films such as the film Bumi Manusia.
